# pwa-examples
Some examples of PWAs as I build a few to learn.

See the [pwa-examples](https://github.com/mdn/pwa-examples) from [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn) for some more mature examples.


## My Examples:
 * [Hello-PWA](hello-pwa): A simple Hello World app for my first PWA.
 
 * [ToDo-PWA](ToDo-PWA): A PWA based on the tutorial [Building a Mobile App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://blog.openreplay.com/building-a-mobile-app-using-html-css-and-javascript). It is close to the original but I made a few changes to fit my way of doing things. The original code is available at [github.com/wisdomekpotu/PWA-TodoApp](https://github.com/wisdomekpotu/PWA-TodoApp).

* [Lonely Globe](lonely-globe): Another PWA based on the tutorial [Getting Started with Offline First using UpUp](https://www.talater.com/upup/getting-started-with-offline-first.html). See the [TalAter/UpUp](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp/tree/master/demo/getting-started-with-offline-first-demo) GitHub repo. Just go down into demo folder for the tutorial code under "getting-started-with-offline-first-demo". The tutorial isn't complete. Had to look at the code on GitHub. And the .min.js.map files weren't complete so changed to using the non-minimized js files from the src folder in the root of the repo.
