## PWA Examples
Some examples of PWAs as I build a few to learn.

See the [pwa-examples](https://github.com/mdn/pwa-examples) from [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn) for some more mature examples.


### My Examples
 - [**Hello-PWA**](hello-pwa): A simple Hello World app for my first PWA. Follow along with James Johnson on his tutorial, [A Simple Progressive Web App Tutorial](https://medium.com/james-johnson/a-simple-progressive-web-app-tutorial-f9708e5f2605), to create your own [PWA](https://github.com/jamesjohnson280/hello-pwa).
 
 - [**ToDo-PWA**](todo-pwa): A PWA based on the tutorial [Building a Mobile App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://blog.openreplay.com/building-a-mobile-app-using-html-css-and-js). It is close to the original but I made a few changes to fit my way of doing things. The original code is available at [github.com/wisdomekpotu/PWA-TodoApp](https://github.com/wisdomekpotu/PWA-TodoApp).

- [**Lonely Globe**](lonely-globe): Another PWA based on the tutorial [Getting Started with Offline First using UpUp](https://www.talater.com/upup/getting-started-with-offline-first.html). See the [TalAter/UpUp](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp/tree/master/demo/getting-started-with-offline-first-demo) GitHub repo. Just go down into demo folder for the tutorial code under "getting-started-with-offline-first-demo". The tutorial isn't complete. Had to look at the code on GitHub. And the .min.js.map files weren't complete so changed to using the non-minimized js files from the src folder in the root of the repo.

### Planned Projects

- **PWA Scaffold**: Feel the need for a bit of scaffolding to build future PWAs. May not need to do this. See the links below.
  - [**PWA Starter**](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter): Trying out this template. Made a [fork](https://github.com/dan-carroll/pwa-starter) of it so I would have a copy. Following these [directions](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/starter/quick-start) to give this thing a trial go of it.
  - [**Simple PWA**](https://github.com/nikkifurls/simplepwa): Simple Progressive Web App (PWA) template. Will (also) be trying this one out in the future. I have also made a [clone](https://github.com/dan-carroll/simplepwa) of this repo to have a copy of it. The documentation for this template is in the README file and on the [website](https://simplepwa.com/), which is also linked to in the repository.

- **Shopping List**: Should be a quick and easy project. Thinking about using the ToDo-PWA as a blueprint.

- **Prayer-PWA**: I can use help in my prayer life. Why not build an app to help? And I could share it.

- **Sales-PWA**: Personal sales app for tracking customers, sales, and expenses. Could come in handy come tax time. Inspired by my spouse's Color Street sales business.
